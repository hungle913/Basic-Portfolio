        <p>Hello! My name is Hung Le. I am looking to learn how to code and do something more challenging. I have changed careers several times throughout the years, mostly not by choice. I started off in IT doing help desk support for a company called Providian Financial. Providian decided to outsource the help desk role to a company in Canda and I was laid off from my job. I switched careers to real estate during the big housing boom. I was a loan doc drawer for Wilmington finance about 2 years until the housing bubble burst. Wilmington Finance went out of business and I was laid off. I then switched careers again to do medicare sales for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue shield. I was doing sales for roughly 2 years before the company decided it was too expensive to have an office in the Bay Area so they forwarded all sales to their southern California location. Once again I was laid off. That is when I decided to go back into IT and was able to get a job as a Desktop Support Technician with Stryker. I was a full time employee with Stryker for 7 years until they decided to elimite the full time desktop support position and outsource to another company. Once again I was given a package and laid off. I am now looking to change careers again.

        <p>I am very excited to learn how to code. It's been 17 years since I have been in school and this is proving to be very tough. But I am super pumped to learn as much as possible and do the best I can. I might be learning a lot slower then the rest of the class but I will not give up! Hoping this will be the start to a great new career that will challenge me and keep things exciting during my day to day work life.

        <p>When I'm feeling stressed or just need a break from the world I love to go fishing. Being on the water is one of the most relaxing things. I can go fishing for hours on end. Catching fish is a bonus. Just being out on the water is the best.</p>
